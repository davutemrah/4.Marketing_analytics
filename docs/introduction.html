<p>Learning new skills takes courage. You must be willing to be a beginner, to experience the awkwardness of not knowing how things work. We are wired to seek comfort and avoid failure. It may seem counter intuitive, but the faster you fail, adjust and try again, the faster you succeed.
As a learner, if you are willing to step outside of your comfort zone, work through your fears and keep going as you acquire each new skill, apply what you learn, eventually you’ll become a pro!</p>

<p>Know Your ‘Why’</p>
<p>Think about why you decided to register for this course. Maybe you are curious about what’s new in marketing analytics, or you are looking for a career change and want to add the certification to your resume, or maybe you are thinking of starting a freelance marketing analytics service or are thinking about adding marketing analytics to your current offerings.
What’s your why? Write it down and post where you can see it every day. Post it by your desk or on your screen. Set it as your wallpaper on your computer or phone.</p>

<p>Knowing what you’re trying to accomplish and having a plan can:<br />
- Help keep connected the reason you chose. Reasons can be such as new skills, job requirement.<br />
- Provide a clear path to reach the result you desire, which allows you to know your next step and know if you’ve achieved it.<br />
- Boost your self-confidence by providing you a framework to come back to when you are frustrated or tired. Knowing why you are working so hard and how you are going to reach your goals can see you through moments you may feel like throwing in the towel.</p>
<p>How to set goals:
- Set a completion date and work backward
- Set your deadlines</p>
<p><strong>Find the Time</strong></p>
<p>Before you set regular study times, it is helpful to understand how you spend your time. Try to capture everything you do in a typical week. Your hour spent at work, family obligations, classes or clubs, time spent on hobbies, exercise and socializing. If you want to get really detailed you can even capture the time you spend on social media or watching television.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Role of marketer<a href="introduction.html#role-of-marketer" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>If you spend some time online, you’ve probably noticed that quite a few of the <strong>ads</strong> you see are for products you’re genuinely interested in and some of these ads may have prompted you to buy. Well, that’s no coincidence. <strong>You likely saw these ads because some underlying data and marketing analysis made the advertiser understand that you might be interested in the product advertised.</strong></p>
<p>That’s just one of the many ways in which marketing analytics powers marketing. In fact, it’s fair to say that all marketing benefits from <code>data</code> and <code>analytics.</code></p>
<p>Marketing is responsible for promoting and selling the products that a company makes. And that usually involves the following steps:
First, the marketers identify the <code>right customers</code> for the product. <code>They think about and research who might be interested in buying the product.</code> They may interview people and use questionnaires to understand their <strong>needs</strong> better and whether these needs might be met by the product they sell.</p>
<p>They will also try to form a better picture of the lives of the people that may want their product. All this is referred to as <code>market</code> or <code>consumer research</code> and it’s an important part of marketing. Marketing analytics is essential in this phase to help analyze the data from the research. Based on this research, marketers will create a message and a story about the products they sell. They will also decide where that message should go so it can reach the customers who may be interested. This may mean creating a website, a Facebook page, or an Instagram account.
And in some cases, creating ads that could be put in magazines, on TV, on the web, and so on. This is the creative part of the marketer’s job.</p>
<p>Many companies will rely on advertising or creative agencies to help them. Coming up with the right message and the right imagery to complement that message is a real art. But marketing analytics is used in this phase as well.</p>
<p>Often <code>marketers will test their messages out and gather data about the ads or promotions they run to try and understand what works best for their audience.</code> To get marketing messages out, marketers need a plan. Marketers will carefully select the different places where they talk about their product.</p>
<p>And if they plan to advertise, they will work on strategies that help them to most effectively spend their advertising budgets. Marketing analysts have an important role to play here. By using data and analytics to create their plan, marketers can save time and money.</p>
<p>Once campaigns and promotions start to run, marketers will watch them carefully and focus on evaluating the results they see, like clicks on ads from campaigns, sales resulting from ads, and so on. Based on that information, marketers will adapt their advertising and their marketing plans. Given that a large share of marketing budget is spent online these days, <code>real-time updates are possible</code> and good marketers will make use of the opportunity by optimizing in real-time as well. But to do it effectively, they need marketing analytics.</p>
<p>After an advertising campaign runs its course, marketers will want to evaluate whether their money was well spent. And they will have to report back to other people in the business on the success of their efforts, so they perform more analysis. And while reporting is essential, this analysis will also help the marketer get better and optimize their message and strategy for their next campaign.The better you are at marketing analytics, the better you’ll be able to optimize and get your message out to the right people in a more efficient way.</p>
<p>Analytics plays a crucial role in marketing. A marketer equipped with good data and analytics, will be a better marketer. Online actions generate loads of data that can be a goldmine for marketers if used well. As a result, marketing analytics skills are in high demand, and all great marketers today rely on analytics to make decisions.</p>
<div id="what-is-marketing-analytics" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> What is marketing analytics?<a href="introduction.html#what-is-marketing-analytics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>It is the practice of measuring and analyzing data to inform, evaluate, and improve the performance of your marketing initiatives. Marketing analytics is all about gathering and analyzing data to make your marketing better.</p>
<p>5 Main Uses of Marketing Analytics</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identifying the target audience</li>
<li>Planning and forecasting</li>
<li>Evaluate marketing effectiveness</li>
<li>Marketing optimization</li>
<li>Optimizing the sales funnel</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s take a look at where the role of the marketing analyst comes in, or how marketing analytics can support and improve marketing.</p>
<p><strong>1. Identifying the target audience:</strong> Marketers have limited budgets, so they want to make sure that their marketing message reaches a <code>receptive</code> audience. Or in other words, they want to talk to people that may have an interest in buying their product. In marketing, they refer to that as your target audience. So how do marketers find that audience? Well, they use research.
Imagine a marketer for a mattress company. They could use surveys to get a better understanding of when people buy mattresses, what they find important when buying a mattress, how much they would spend on a mattress, and so on. They might also use some databases that exist about mattress sales, and the demographics of the people who buy them. All of this will help describe who the best target audience is for the mattresses.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are their characteristics?<br />
</li>
<li>Where do they live?</li>
<li>What phase of their life are they in, and so on?</li>
</ul>
<p>All the information the marketer gathers comes in the form of data. And marketing analytics will help to make sense of that data and paint the detailed picture of the target audience the marketer needs to create the marketing message and get in front of the interested people.</p>
<p><strong>2. Planning and forecasting:</strong> Marketing and advertising can be expensive. So before marketers spend their budgets, they evaluate where and when they should put their marketing message. They will carefully think about how much of their time and how much of their budgets should be spent on social media, ads on TV, radio, search engines, and so on. Often, marketers will take a look back at their previous marketing efforts, and on the basis of the success they have had with campaigns in all of these different places, they may decide to spend more or less money in some of them this time around.</p>
<p>The mattress company may use data from the previous year to determine the mix of advertising for the coming year. They may have learned, for instance, that advertising on TV and social media really worked for them, but that there was little payoff from the ads on the radio. Often, this exercise comes with a detailed forecast of the sales they can expect based on the budget they plan to spend. This is where marketing analytics comes in. The more a marketer can rely on data and analysis in this phase, the better the results of their marketing will be. After marketing campaign is over, marketers will take a look back and ask themselves whether their campaign was effective. It helps them to learn more about what worked and what didn’t work. But they’re also doing it to report back to other people in the company.</p>
<p><strong>3. Evaluate marketing effectiveness:</strong> They’re given a budget, and management typically expects a report on how the budget was spent and how successful the marketing was. For our mattress marketer, there may be a quarterly management meeting in which the marketer reports the sales that resulted from the marketing campaign. The marketer may also use this opportunity to show data on the ads that worked best, the placement of these ads that generated the largest audience and sales, and so on.</p>
<p>Showing that the marketing was effective is crucial for most marketers, as it will help them to get the budget they need for success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>4. Marketing optimization:</strong> Even after very careful planning and forecasting, things can always be improved. This is true with marketing too. Once a marketing campaign is up and running and you collect or gather data on how it is performing, there is an opportunity to optimize. And the more data you have, and the more you know about analytics, the better you’ll be able to fine-tune and optimize your marketing. As soon as you get some information on how your ads are performing, you can use that information to adjust your marketing.</p>
<p>Say for our mattress company, if you learn from the initial data that certain search engine ads are delivering more sales than others, you could decide to spend a bit more money on the ads that perform well, and less on the ads that don’t. If you can take these kinds of actions, you optimize how your money is spent. Data and analytics are really powerful that way, and can save you quite a bit of money.</p>
<p><strong>5. Optimizing the sales funnel:</strong> Finally, there’s a specific task of making sure that people who want to purchase a product or have shown an interest can easily do so. Marketers will refer to that as optimizing the sales funnel. That is because they think of the sales process in a few steps. For instance, you could think of the sales process in four steps.</p>
<p><strong>Awareness</strong> – <strong>Interest</strong> – <strong>Decision</strong> – <strong>Action</strong></p>
<p>Awareness; or when a person first hears about a product. Then Interest; which is when a person is interested in the product and may try to learn a bit more about it. Then there is the Decision step when a person decides that they want to get your product. And then there is the Action step, when they buy your product.</p>
<p>Marketers described this process as a funnel, because as people go through this process, some people drop-off and don’t take the next step. So when you draw the group of people that go through the four steps, the groups get gradually smaller.</p>
<p>And when you put these groups together, it looks like a funnel. When marketers talk about optimizing the funnel, they really talk about reducing the number of people that drop out.</p>
<p>Say for our mattress marketer, it’s important that as many people as possible who are aware of the mattress become interested. And of the people who are interested, you want as many as possible to decide that they want your mattress. And then you want them to take action and buy your mattress. Since the marketer spends money on getting people to consider the mattress, they want as many people as possible to take all four steps and check out.</p>
<p>Data and analytics will help inform marketers about how healthy their sales funnel is, how many people drop out and don’t take the next step, and why that may be.</p>

<div id="the-future-of-marketing-is-data" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> The Future of Marketing is Data<a href="introduction.html#the-future-of-marketing-is-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The future of marketing will be defined by analytics. Marketers must use data to more accurately understand who their customer is and predict what their future behavior will be.</p>
<p>Marketing is all about personal connection. <code>It's about filling a need or desire a customer has with a product or service you offer, and providing value to that customer while doing so.</code> Marketing connects people with a problem they want solved to the business that can solve it. But too often, companies are simply guessing at who may need their product or service, and may advertise the features of their products without articulating any of the benefits to their customer. Or, they may just assume that everyone will want their product and never put the effort into identifying a target audience of those who will not only benefit from the product or service they offer, but who can become brand ambassadors in the future. Additionally, consumers today expect personalized experiences with the brands they interact with, from unique online and brick-and-mortar experiences, to customized product offerings, to a personable voice on social media. Just as a blanket advertising approach doesn’t work for organizations, a one-size-fits-all experience doesn’t work for customers.</p>
<p>But marketers don’t just need better awareness about making personal connections with their audience, they need tools to do it as well. <strong>There’s a shift in looking at how well each product performs to how valuable each customer is</strong>, and marketers can only get to know their customer and create that personal connection with data.</p>
<p>With data, marketers can learn:<br />
- what products each customer has bought in the past<br />
- what social media content is resulting in the most purchases<br />
- what keywords customers are searching for<br />
- age, gender, and location<br />
- what their interests are<br />
- how to market to those customer in the future</p>
<p>This is why the future of marketing will be defined by analytics, or using data in order to more accurately understand who the customer is, what their past behavior has been, and what their future behavior will be. The future of business growth and success will belong to organizations who will use data in smart, insightful, applicable ways.</p>
<div id="marketing-trends-for-a-data-driven-future" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Marketing Trends for a Data-Driven Future<a href="introduction.html#marketing-trends-for-a-data-driven-future" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As we see an increase in data-driven customer connections, here are some trends we’ll see in the future of marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Smarter use of data</strong></p>
<p>Marketing teams will increase their use of data in order to learn more about their customers, which will create better targeting, personalization, and connection. More personalized marketing means more returns, as 80% of consumers say they’d be more likely to purchase from a brand that offers personalized experiences, and 72% say they only engage with marketing messages that are specific to their interests.</p>
<p><strong>Growth of AI</strong></p>
<p>There will be an increase in use of AI, machine learning, and algorithms in marketing, as it can predict patterns and make recommendations based on the insights it sees. Already, algorithms choose 70% of what viewers watch on YouTube and 75% of what viewers watch on Netflix, and recommendation algorithms drive 35% of sales on Amazon. Additionally, automation will increase as well, with Gartner predicting that “By 2023, autonomous marketing systems will issue 55% of multichannel marketing messages based on marketer criteria and real-time consumer behavior, resulting in a 25% increase in response rates.”</p>
<p><strong>Shift to first-party data</strong></p>
<p>As Google is phasing out its use of cookies, organizations will shift from third-party data to first- and second-party data, which will help them understand their customer more precisely.</p>
<p>Giving customers transparency into how data is collected will be a priority as well. According to Kevin Cochrane, the CMO of SAP Customer Experience, “<em>To initiate a more trustworthy relationship, organizations must start by eliminating internal processes of acquiring third-party data. They must use only data that they have earned through explicit customer consent. … Moving forward, consumers should (and will) have full visibility into how extensively their personal data is being monetized.</em>”</p>
<p><strong>More online data</strong></p>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic shifted life online, organizations suddenly saw an increase in new data they could collect about their customers, and the trend will only increase. “In the absence of the face-to-face, we had to lean in on digital, and that allowed us to have the information, the data, to then better serve our customers,” notes Kevin Warren, CMO of UPS. “This year really has revealed that strategic importance of analytics that maybe wasn’t quite there pre-COVID.”</p>
<p><strong>Better budget optimization</strong></p>
<p>As marketing teams are able to better target their customers, they’ll be able to better optimize their budgets. In wanting to optimize its marketing budget, <code>DoorDash first looked at which ads brought in new customers</code>, drew channel-level cost curves based on the data, and created better ways to deliver. “Accurate, timely, and fine-grained attribution data is the key to understanding and optimizing our marketing,” they explain.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> An Application<a href="introduction.html#an-application" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>We are going to refer to an imaginary company, DCB Cleaning Services. They are a company that provides office cleaning services in the San Francisco Bay Area. James manages marketing for the company. Recently he presented an idea for a new product to his management, Snackwall. It’s a service where the company installs a snack wall in an office. Customers subscribe to the service and select their snacks and refills through an app. Management was very excited about his idea and developed the product. James was given a marketing budget to launch the new service. We’ll follow James and look at some of the decisions he needs to make.</p>
<p>James at DCB Cleaning is excited to bring Snackwall to market and he’s gearing up to launch. With a quickly approaching launch date and limited budget, James knows that it is essential to get the message about Snackwall in front of the <strong>right audience;</strong> people who may be interested in the service. Given his limited budget, he wants to make sure not to waste any of his money on people in offices where Snackwall would likely not be a good fit.</p>
<p>James needs to define his target audience. James believes that it will be best to promote Snackwall among the <strong>existing</strong> DCB Cleaning clients. But he does not think all the clients will be interested.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of who may have an interest, James decides to create a <strong>survey.</strong> He divides his survey in three parts. In the 1st part, he asks questions about the office space. How many people work in the office? Is most of the work desk work? Where’s the office located? How far is the office from the convenience stores? Does the office provide lunch, etc.? In the 2nd part, James asks about the employees and the work they do. What is the average age of the employees at the location? What’s the education level? What industry is the company in? In the final part of the questionnaire, James describes Snackwall and asks the level of interest in the product, from not at all interested to very interested. James’ survey goes out to all 300 clients of DCB Cleaning. It’s an online survey and 200 clients fill it out. Now that James has the answers to his questions, he goes to his marketing analyst, Alia, who had suggested to survey in the first place and who will help James analyze the results. Alia sorts all the responses in a spreadsheet. Then, she runs the segmentation analysis on the data. Segmentation is a technique we will learn more about later in this program. It’s a way to sort people in groups based on characteristics they have in common. In this case, Alia uses segmentation to get a better understanding of the characteristics that people who are interested in Snackwall have in common. After Alia runs her analysis, she finds that there are two distinct groups that have a very high interest in Snackwall. She presents her results to James. The 1st group she named “Focused Tech”. This group includes companies that have over 30 employees, provide lunch on-site, are active in the tech industry, and are primarily employing engineers and have a young workforce. The 2nd group Alia refers to as “Isolated Office”. This group includes companies with between 30 and 50 employees located outside of the urban areas with little access to food. They don’t provide lunch for their workers. They are in various industries and their workforce is young. Alia also tells James that the Focused Tech segment is quite a bit larger than the Isolated Office group. This information is super helpful for James. Using the information provided in the survey responses, James does a bit more work on describing these two audience groups. He plans to target his first advertising campaign to the Focused Tech audience. He will advertise to his current clients, but he will also use this information to find more companies that are similar to the audience in the Focused Tech segment.</p>
<p>The segmentation that James’ marketing analyst Alia did for him helped James define his target audience. He knows that narrowing his advertising to this target audience will help him spend his budget wisely since it will increase the chance that his ads will be seen by people who are interested in his product. For any marketer who’s trying to define their target audience, marketing analytics is crucial.</p>
