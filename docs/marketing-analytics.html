<p>Coursera: Marketing Analytics</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing is both an art and science</li>
<li>Analytics provides marketing managers the opportunity to test intuition about marketing.<br />
</li>
<li>More and more data are collected every second. More data is collecting on consumer choices. We better understand how and what consumers are interested in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data can be used to maximize profits.</p>
<p>Data is used to develop businesses decision support system.</p>
<p>Data driven decisions.</p>
<p>Data can be used to improve marketing process. You can use reviews, price, other factors that may affect customer decisions.</p>
<p>My advance education in economics has helped me with business understanding.</p>
<p>Marketing Process</p>
<p>Start with objectives: customer, company, competitor, collaborator, context.
Strategy: segmentation, targeting, positioning
Tactics: product, price, place, promotion
Financials: Margin, ROI, CLV How do company make money?</p>
<p>How to improve customer experience?
Sharing economy context</p>
<p>Objectives: University of Kansas: students are the customers, campus, other colleges, faculty, education</p>
<p>Strategy: When setting the strategy, first step is segmentation to determine which customers are align with your objective.
Segmentation: we want to cluster our customers into segments. Segmentation can be based on location, adventure, price, vacation, family, students. Segmentation divides a potential market into groups with similar characteristics that will be targeted in the marketing campaign.
In order to determine where you will focus your marketing strategy, you will need to segment your customer base into subgroups that share similar characteristics.</p>
<p>Targeting:</p>
<p>Positioning: Positioning is an element of strategy where you distinguish your product from similar products on the market.</p>
<p>Marketing analytics includes descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Predictive analytics will allow you to predict the impact of each marketing campaign and estimate the likelihood of future outcomes. Predictive analytics give you insight into the future; in this case, how the market will likely respond to the ad campaign.</p></li>
<li></li>
<li><p>Descriptive analytics tell you about what happened in the past or the current state, but do not help you figure out next steps. You will be analyzing the survey data from customers about what happened in the past to gain insights about customer preferences.</p></li>
<li><p>You will want to conduct prescriptive analytics to determine what your company should do to assure your customers about the high salt content. Prescriptive analytics yields insight about which actions to take to achieve your goal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AIRBNB EXAMPLE</p>
<p>Strategic challenge: how do we improve rental prospects for our hosts and identify better rental options for our guests?</p>
<p>Mental Model:
Profit per Property ï Gross Margin (%)
Profit per Property &lt;- Price, # of rentals, minimum stay</p>
<p>What is the value of brands?</p>
<p>Brand is not just a name, color, shape or logo. It is a complex entity.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brand personality is part of larger concept of brand architecture. Analytics help us identify how marketing affects brand architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Marketers use data to tweak features and benefits to create a stronger connection between customers and the brand</p></li>
<li><p>Marketers analyze data around marketing campaigns and their impact on all the components of brand architectures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Product attributes: features of the product.</p>
<ul>
<li>What a brand means to a consumer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers buy benefits, not features. When building up brand architecture, knowing the benefits helps with consistent messaging to consumers.</p>
<p>Brand personality contributes to the strength of a brand, but isnât used to determine brand strength.</p>
<p>The architecture of a brand is not part of calculating brand value, but it is important to understanding what the brand means to consumers.</p>
<p>Brand Asset Valuator matrix
Top left quadrant: Your brandâs strength as measured by differentiation and relevance is already quite high, so you should focus your efforts towards improving other dimensions of the brand.</p>
<p>Measuring Brand Value</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Y&amp;R goes beyond financials to provide diagnostics which can allow marketers to improve the brand</p></li>
<li><p>Y&amp;R measures brand strength and stature, while Interbrand also looks at financials.</p></li>
<li><p>Y&amp;R is helpful for improving brands; Interbrand is helpful during a merger &amp; acquisition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While you would want to look at many models to value the brand, the most important when acquiring a brand is the Interbrand model, since it gives a dollar measure of the brandâs strength, financial performance, and influence on customer decisions.</p>
<p>The Revenue Premium as a Measure of Brand Equity model should be used for items found in a typical grocery store, since it compares generic items against private labels using data from receipts.</p>
<p>Measures of Brand Equity:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Intrabrand brand ranking</li>
<li>Y&amp;R Brand Asset Valuator</li>
<li>Revenue Premium</li>
</ol>
<p>Revenue Premium: This method assumes that branded and private label products are similar in all aspects except their brand names. The revenue premium model looks at how much revenue a brand generates by comparing the branded product to private label products and assumes that the only difference between the two products is the brand (which is generally true of supermarket items).</p>
<p>Risk is a component of the long-term multiplier, not the entire equation.</p>
<p>The long-term multiplier is (1+D)/(1+D-R), where R is the stability factor. If R increases, (1+D-R) decreases, so the long-term multiplier increases.</p>
<p>Revenue premium: (0.35 * 1.50 * 7 - 12% * 0.80 * 7) = 3
Additional variable cost: (0.35-0.12) * 0.75 * 0.80 * 7</p>
<p>Brand Equity = Revenue premium - Additional variable cost = [(0.35 * 1.50 * 7 - 12% * 0.80 * 7) - (0.35-0.12) * 0.75 * 0.80 * 7] * 125 million = 253.75 million</p>
<p>Annual brand equity</p>
<p>The difference in the annual revenue premium and the variable cost for multiplied by all the households in the market</p>
<p>When calculating brand equity, what does the long-term multiplier represent? Wrong A way to determine the risk of a brand in the future
What does the revenue premium as measure of brand equity quantify?
Wrong The expected additional demand generated by a branded product over an equivalent unbranded product</p>
<p>Your company is concerned that its brand power is eroding. What model would be most useful in determining how to improve the brand? Y &amp; R Brand Asset Valuator Model</p>
<p>According to the Y&amp;R Brand Asset Valuator, what are the key differences in knowledge and differentiation between a new brand and a declining brand? New brands are lower in stature than a declining brand.</p>
<p>If your brand is in the top left quadrant of the Brand Asset Valuator matrix, what should be your strategic priority?
Wrong Enhancing brand strength</p>
<p>Why do marketers focus so much time on developing a brandâs architecture?
Wrong To determine brand value</p>
<p>Which of the following is a product benefit for a Honda Civic car? Comfortable
Why do marketers spend so much time creating brand personalities?
Wrong To determine the brand strength</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Data Analytics<a href="marketing-analytics.html#data-analytics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>We can define data analytics as the process of collecting, cleaning, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to uncover insights and make informed decisions.</p>
<div id="data-analytics-vs.-data-science" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Data Analytics vs.Â Data Science<a href="marketing-analytics.html#data-analytics-vs.-data-science" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As you continue to learn about data, you will come across tons of data-related terminology. Among these are two often-confused terms: data analysts and data scientists. These two roles are similar in the sense that they both work with data to gather insights, but how they work with data is what sets them apart. In this reading, you will learn the differences between these two disciplines by reviewing their roles, responsibilities, skills, and backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysts</strong></p>
<p>Data analysts work with structured data to identify patterns, build visualizations, and extract meaningful insights that help organizations make informed decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Data analysts are typically responsible for maintaining databases, interpreting data sets, and creating reports that effectively present data trends, patterns, and predictions. Some common tasks include gathering data from various sources, cleaning and organizing data, and presenting findings in easy-to-understand visualizations.</p>
<p><strong>Skills and Tools</strong></p>
<p>Foundational mathematics and statistics</p>
<p>Analytical thinking and data visualization</p>
<p>Basic fluency in R, Python, and SQL</p>
<p>SAS, Excel, and business intelligence software</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Data analysts are commonly experienced in mathematics and statistics. They might also have a degree in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or finance.</p>
<p><strong>Data Scientists</strong></p>
<p>Data scientists work with various data types, including structured and unstructured data. They use advanced data techniques, including machine learning and predictive modeling, to design processes, develop models, and extract insights from data.</p>
<p>Responsibilities</p>
<p>Data scientists are typically responsible for arranging undefined datasets, writing algorithms, building automation systems, and statistical models. Some of their common tasks include gathering and cleaning raw data, creating data visualization tools, dashboards, and reports, and developing code to automate data collection and processing.</p>
<p>Skills and Tools</p>
<p>Advanced statistics and predictive analytics</p>
<p>Machine learning and data modeling</p>
<p>High-level, object-oriented programming</p>
<p>Hadoop, MySQL, TensorFlow, and Spark</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Data scientists are commonly experienced in computer science and are generally required to have a masterâs or doctoral degree in data science, information technology, mathematics, or statistics.</p>
<p>Although their titles are similar, data analysts and data scientists have distinct roles, requirements, and career paths. Now that you know the difference between the two, consider this as you continue your journey in data analysis.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Although these two disciplines are very similar and often go hand-in-hand in terms of skills and how they work with data, there are some subtle differences to keep in mind as you explore which focus youâd like to pursue in how you work with data.</p>
<p>Letâs break down each component of this definition.</p>

<div id="sampled-data" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.1.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2.1</span> Sampled Data<a href="marketing-analytics.html#sampled-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Sampled data is data from a subset of a larger population or a larger data set thatâs used to represent the entire population or data. In other words, you are a smaller number of data, thatâs a good representation of the total data set you would like to study.</p>
<p>Itâs a common practice in data analytics to sample data, because analyzing the entire population can be costly, time consuming, or even impossible. Sampling allows us to draw conclusions about the population while only analyzing a fraction of it.</p>
<p>Letâs run through some situations where sampled data is necessary. First, the population might be too large. When dealing with large data sets or populations, analyzing the entire data set can be impractical or impossible.</p>
<p>Imagine you are a market researcher and you work for a large auto manufacturer, the company wants to get a better understanding of their customer satisfaction. They would like to know how satisfied their car buyers are with the performance of the cars, as well as with the service theyâre getting from the dealerships.</p>
<p>You know, you can get all this information using a survey in which you ask customers questions about their experience and have them rate how satisfied they are. But because your company has <strong>hundreds of thousands</strong> of customers, itâs not practical to send a survey to each individual who owns one of your cars. Instead, you decide to send a survey to a sample of your customer base, a smaller group of customers that you will select as a representation of the larger customer population.</p>
<p>Second, and related to the first point, you might have <strong>cost constraints</strong>, collecting data from an entire population can be expensive. Sampling can be more <strong>cost effective</strong>, allowing researchers to allocate resources to other important tasks. In our example, for the car company, surveying everyone would cost a lot of money just in getting the surveys out to everyone. But it would cost you even more to get responses from all these customers. You might need to use incentives to get customers to answer, which could cost a lot of money if youâre talking to hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>You could also face <strong>time constraints</strong>, collecting data from an entire population can also be time consuming. Sampling can save time and allow researchers to collect and analyze data quickly. For our car company, collecting responses from a very large group of people would take you quite a bit more time than focusing on a smaller number of customers who bought a car from your company.</p>
<p>In some cases, it might not be possible to analyze the entire population because it would be destroyed in the process. Data analysts refer to this as <strong>destructive sampling</strong>. For example, testing every product manufactured in a candy factory would result in the destruction of the entire inventory and the destruction of your teeth, but thatâs not really whatâs referred to here.</p>
<p>So for all of these reasons, you might be dealing with a subset of the data instead of the whole data set, or in other words, a sample. But when you work with sample data, there are a few things you should consider to help you evaluate the quality of your data.</p>
<p>First, the sample size. Sample size is the number of observations in the sample. A larger sample size generally provides more accurate estimates of the population. If the sample size is small, it might not give you enough to work with, and the data might not accurately represent the population.</p>
<p>A smaller sample will also limit the types of analyses you can perform on your data, because certain analyses require many observations to provide an accurate result.</p>
<p>In other words, if you want a reliable analysis, larger samples are usually a must. The sample should also be representative of the population being studied. If the sample is biased, the conclusions drawn from the sample might not be valid for the entire population.</p>
<p>Letâs say you are conducting a study on the average salary of employees in a certain company. The company has a total of 1000 employees, and you decide to survey 50 of them to collect data on their salaries. However, you only choose to survey employees who work in the finance department because you assume that their salaries will be representative of the entire company. In this scenario, the sample is not representative of the entire population of the company because it only includes employees from one department.</p>
<p>The sample is biased towards finance employees and might not be accurate for the entire company. This can lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn from the data, such as assuming that the entire company has a higher average salary than it actually does.</p>
<p>To ensure representativeness, it would be better to use a more random sampling method that includes employees from different departments and positions. Such a sample would better represent the entire company, and it will give you a more accurate read on the average salary.</p>
<p>Another important thing to think about when using samples is the generalizability of your sample. The conclusions drawn from the sample might not be applicable to other populations. Itâs important to be aware of the limitations of the sample and not over generalize the findings.</p>
<p>Letâs say you are conducting a study on the eating habits of college students in a particular university. You decide to collect data by surveying 100 randomly selected students who attend to university. However, your study only includes students who attend that specific university, which means that the conclusions drawn from the study might not be generalizable to all college students or to the population at large.</p>
<p>This is because the students attending that university might have different demographics, cultural backgrounds, and socioeconomic statuses compared to students at other universities. For example, the university in question might be located in an urban area and attract more students from low income households. This means that the studyâs findings might not be applicable to students attending universities in suburban or rural areas or students from higher income households. Therefore, itâs important to consider the generalizability of the sample when conducting research to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions or making incorrect generalizations about a larger population patient.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Sampled data is a useful tool in data analytics when dealing with large populations or data sets. However, itâs important to consider the sample size, representativeness, and generalizability when working with sampled data to ensure that the conclusions drawn are valid.</p>
