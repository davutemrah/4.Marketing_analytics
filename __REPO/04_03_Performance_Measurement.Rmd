## Comparing Audiences

To measure the performance of your LAL (Lookalike Audience) over purchased audiences in terms of website visits and inquiry starts (your conversions), you can proceed as follows:

---

### Define KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):

Identify and define measurable KPIs to compare the two audiences. For example:

- **Visit Rate:** \((\text{Website Visits} / \text{Impressions}) \times 100\)

- **Inquiry Start Rate:** \((\text{Inquiry Starts} / \text{Website Visits}) \times 100\)

- **Conversion Rate (Overall):** \((\text{Inquiry Starts} / \text{Impressions}) \times 100\)

---

### Gather the Data:

For both LAL and purchased audiences, collect:

- Total impressions

- Website visits

- Inquiry starts

- Spend (if applicable, to evaluate cost efficiency)


### Calculate Performance Metrics:

Using the KPIs above, calculate the performance for both audiences:

- Compare raw performance metrics.

- Normalize by impressions, cost, or other relevant factors to ensure comparability.


### Run Statistical Tests:

Perform significance tests to evaluate if observed differences in performance are statistically meaningful:

- **Chi-square test:** For comparing visit and inquiry rates.

- **T-test:** For comparing average spend per conversion (if applicable).


### Control for Other Variables:

Account for potential confounding factors such as:

- Seasonal trends

- Campaign design differences (e.g., creative quality, timing)

Using a regression-based approach (e.g., logistic regression), you can predict conversion likelihood while controlling for these factors:

\[
P(\text{conversion}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Audience} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Spend} + \ldots)}}
\]

Here, **Audience** is a binary variable (1 = LAL, 0 = Purchased).


### Calculate Incrementality (Optional):

- If you have a holdout group for either audience, calculate **incremental lift**:

\[
\text{Lift} = \frac{\text{Conversion Rate (Exposed Audience)} - \text{Conversion Rate (Holdout)}}{\text{Conversion Rate (Holdout)}}
\]


### Create Visualizations:

- Bar charts to compare conversion metrics side-by-side.

- Line graphs or cohort analyses to show trends over time.

- Funnel charts to display audience progression from impressions to inquiry starts.


### Deliverable Example:

| Metric                  | LAL Audience | Purchased Audience | Comparison (LAL vs Purchased) |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Impressions             | X,XXX,XXX   | Y,YYY,YYY          | â€”                              |
| Website Visits          | A,AAA       | B,BBB              | (+xx%)                        |
| Inquiry Starts          | C,CCC       | D,DDD              | (+yy%)                        |
| Visit Rate              | xx%         | yy%                | (+zz%)                        |
| Inquiry Start Rate      | xx%         | yy%                | (+zz%)                        |

By following this structure, you can demonstrate whether the LAL audience performs better and provide actionable insights to your client.
