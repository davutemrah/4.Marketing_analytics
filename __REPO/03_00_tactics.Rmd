# Marketing Tactics


A **marketing funnel** is a model that represents the customer journey from initial awareness to eventual purchase. It is typically divided into three stages:

1. **Top of the Funnel (Awareness)**: This stage focuses on creating awareness of a brand or product. It targets a broad audience to introduce them to the business, aiming to capture attention and generate interest.
  
   - **Tactics**: Display ads, social media marketing, blog posts, videos, PR campaigns.
  
   - **Metrics**: Impressions, reach, website traffic, brand recall.

2. **Middle of the Funnel (Consideration)**: In this stage, the audience is already aware of the brand, and the goal is to nurture their interest and push them toward evaluating the product or service. This phase involves building trust, educating the potential customer, and addressing pain points.
  
   - **Tactics**: Email marketing, retargeting ads, content marketing (webinars, whitepapers), comparison tools, case studies.
  
   - **Metrics**: Engagement (clicks, time spent), leads, email signups, downloads.

3. **Bottom of the Funnel (Conversion)**: This is the final stage where the focus is on converting potential customers into paying customers. It typically involves more direct, action-oriented marketing tactics designed to drive purchase or sign-ups.
   
   - **Tactics**: Personalized offers, discounts, demos, free trials.
   
   - **Metrics**: Conversions, sales, ROI, customer acquisition cost (CAC).
