### Look-alike Modeling



**What is a Look-Alike?**

Look-alike audiences are the prospects who are having similar traits, behavior like your already existing customers.

Look-alike modeling is a process that essentially helps you in finding look-alike audiences of your best, most profitable customers. It is a modelling approach that can be used by marketers to define customers who are most likely to engage with their marketing messages or activities. This model analyzes and considers common behaviors or traits among the current customers and seeks potential customers who have similar characteristics.


**Seed Data** is data of existing customers based on whom we want to find look-alike audiences.

**Pool Data** is the customer database, in which we would look for customers who are
look-alikes to seed data. Pool data could be collected from various sources.

**Extended Look-Alikes Audience** are the look-alike audience generated by the model from pool audience, based on seed data.



**Benefits of Look-Alike Modeling**

Look-Alike model plays a key role in making business and marketing related decisions. Helps in understanding existing customer base and expand business reach by only focusing on your best customers with a stable business model.

**1. Effective Targeting**

Look-Alike model helps businesses and marketers to execute better marketing campaigns by limiting their focus to those prospects who are similar to the target customers on whom the business is interested in.


**2. Lower Acquisition Cost**

Customer Cost Acquisition (CAC) cost is, in general, approximately 6-7 times costlier than Customer Retention Cost (CRC). But by relying on look-alike modeling, businesses can reduce CAC as they would only spend their marketing efforts on potential customers (look-alikes) who are more likely to convert.


**3. Loyal and Profitable Customer Base**

Look-alike modeling helps you in building a **highly profitable** customer base, by allowing you to target the look-alikes of those customers with high Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) ensuring a highly profitable customer base for your business, in the long run.




**What is Look-alike Modeling**

Look-alike modeling is essentially finding groups of people (audiences) who look and act like your best, most profitable customers. For example, let’s say you run an ecommerce store and you’ve identified that your best audience are people whose average purchase is over $100, buy cosmetics and perfumes, and make a purchase at least twice a month; look-alike modeling would allow you to find more people like that.









**How to Look-alike Modeling (LAL)?**

- Demand Side Platforms (DSP) can perform LAL modeling 

- Data Management Platforms can conduct LAL modeling

- Requires data collection and modeling

- Define the attributes and behaviors of your most valuable customers.

The stricter your look-alike model is (the more attributes you define), the better chance you have of finding your target — albeit smaller — audience, which will allow you to improve campaign performance. Meaning if the model is more complex, then accuracy of the model increase.

However, you could be less strict with the look-alike model (i.e. define less attributes and behaviors) if your goal is to focus on **overall reach** and awareness rather than higher conversion rates.

- A look-alike model that has tightly defined (more) attributes and behaviors, and one that has loosely defined (less) attributes and behaviors.


The third step involves using algorithms to extend the audience based on the look-alike model.

The DMP or DSP would analyze the seed audience (the pre-defined **best** customers) and then apply proprietary algorithms to the data you’ve collected in order to find user profiles that match the seed audience.


**Goal: Prospecting and Increasing Campaign Reach**

Look-alike modeling is mainly used for prospecting, which involves finding new potential customers and/or visitors. However, it can also be used to extend the reach of online advertising campaigns.

Let’s say you target audiences based on a set of attributes (e.g. age, gender, location, etc.). By applying look-alike modeling to your campaigns, you can find similar customers who perhaps don’t fit your current audiences either because we don’t have enough data (e.g. we lack the attributes needed to make a match) or they don’t fit your current audiences (i.e. they consists of other attributes) but are still similar in many ways to your best customers.



**LAL Modeling vs Classification Modeling**

Look-alike modeling and classification modeling are two distinct techniques used in data analysis and machine learning, often employed in marketing and predictive analytics contexts.

Look-alike Modeling:
Definition: Look-alike modeling, also known as similarity modeling or clone modeling, involves identifying individuals or entities in a target group who resemble those in a source group based on certain characteristics.
Process: It begins with a source group of individuals or entities with known traits or behaviors of interest. Machine learning algorithms then analyze these traits to identify patterns and similarities. These patterns are then applied to a larger population to find individuals or entities who closely resemble those in the source group.
Application: Look-alike modeling is commonly used in marketing to identify potential customers who share characteristics with existing customers or high-value prospects. It helps in targeting marketing campaigns more effectively by focusing resources on individuals with a higher likelihood of conversion.


Classification Modeling:
Definition: Classification modeling involves categorizing data points into predefined classes or categories based on their features or attributes.
Process: In classification modeling, historical data with known outcomes is used to train machine learning algorithms. These algorithms learn patterns from the input data and assign new data points to predefined classes or categories based on their similarities to the training data.
Application: Classification modeling is widely used in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. Examples include spam email detection, sentiment analysis, disease diagnosis, and credit risk assessment. The model predicts the class or category to which a new data point belongs based on its features.
In summary, look-alike modeling focuses on finding individuals or entities similar to a known group, while classification modeling focuses on categorizing data points into predefined classes or categories based on their features. Both techniques are valuable in different contexts and can provide insights for decision-making and targeting in various industries.
