It's easier to sell to an existing customer than it is to acquire a new one.


**Why is customer lifetime value important?**

1. Increasing CLV can increase revenue over time.
2. It can help you find issues so you can boost customer loyalty and retention. 
3. It helps you target your ideal customers.
4. Increasing CLV can help reduce customer acquisition costs.
5. CLV can simplify financial planning.
6. CLV trends can show you how to improve your products and services

Customer lifetime value helps you understand the growth and revenue value of each customer over time. This metric is important to any business because it can help your business:

- Boost customer loyalty
- Reduce churn
- Improve strategic decision-making

For example, you can use customer lifetime value to find the customer segments that are most valuable to your company.

Here are some other reasons why understanding your CLV is essential.

**1. Increasing CLV can increase revenue over time.**

The longer the lifecycle or the more value a customer brings during that lifecycle, the more revenue a business earns. Therefore, tracking and improving CLV results in more revenue.

CLV helps you find the specific customers that contribute the most revenue to your business. You can use this information to segment your audience by the value those customers bring.

Once you find those customers, you can encourage repeat purchases and find specific cross-selling and upselling opportunities for different segments of your audience. Or you can tailor your products or marketing to your highest spenders to keep them coming back for more.

**2. It can help you identify issues so you can boost customer loyalty and retention.**

If CLV is a priority in your business, you can use it to identify impactful trends in your customer data. 

This insight can help you stay ahead of competition with action items to address those changes.

CLV helps you understand customer behavior, preferences, and spending patterns. With this analysis, you can improve your data-driven decision-making. This leads to more personalized marketing strategies for growth.

For example, say your CLV is low. You can work to optimize your customer support strategy or loyalty program to better meet the needs of your customers. Or you can optimize a new product to attract higher-value customers.

**3. It helps you target your ideal customers.**

Customer lifetime value tracking makes it easier to segment your customers. You can segment based on profitability, customer needs, preferences, or behavior.

When you know the lifetime value of a customer, you also know how much money they spend with your business over some time — whether it's $50, $500, or $5000.

Armed with that knowledge, you can develop a customer acquisition strategy that targets customers who will spend the most at your business. You can personalize marketing to attract and retain them, and effectively allocate resources to get the most value from your efforts.

**4. Increasing CLV can help reduce customer acquisition costs.**

Acquiring new customers can be costly, and it's less expensive to retain a customer than it is to acquire a new one.

Customer lifetime value can help reduce costs with a focus on retaining existing customers. If you can keep a customer happy long-term, then you can improve their value to the business.

Using CLV metrics can improve customer loyalty and word-of-mouth referrals — it can also reduce marketing and sales expenses.

**5. CLV can simplify Financial planning.**

The financial health of a business is often a big concern for CEOs and business owners.

Customer lifetime value helps you get a clear picture of your customers' relationship with your business and products. It can offer insights into future revenue streams and changes in customer behavior.

This knowledge can help you make more accurate predictions about future cash flows. So, CLV helps you reliably forecast revenue and plan the financial future of your business.

**6. CLV trends can show you how to improve your products and services.**

Understanding CLV can give you a better understanding of the value customers get from specific products or services.

With insights from your CLV you'll have a clear direction for further analysis. This may guide you to look at customer feedback and behavior, update pain points, or change your approach to product development.

Lifetime value data can help you find where to make key improvements that align with customer needs and boost satisfaction. This not only strengthens customer loyalty but also differentiates your company from competitors.

Now that we understand the importance of customer lifetime value, let's talk about the two main customer lifetime value models.

**Customer Lifetime Value Models**

There are two models that companies will use to measure customer lifetime value.

Choosing between the two can result in different outcomes.

This depends on whether a business is looking at pre existing data, or trying to figure out the future behavior of customers based on current circumstances.

**Predictive Customer Lifetime Value**

The predictive CLV model forecasts the buying behavior of existing and new customers using regression or machine learning.

Using the predictive model for customer lifetime value helps you better identify your most valuable customers, the product or service that brings in the most sales, and how you can improve customer retention.

**Historical Customer Lifetime Value**

The historical model uses past data to predict the value of a customer without considering whether the existing customer will continue with the company or not.

With the historical model, the average order value is used to determine the value of your customers. You'll find this model to be especially useful if most of your customers only interact with your business over a certain period.

But because most customer journeys are not identical, this model has certain drawbacks.

Active customers (deemed valuable by the historical model) might become inactive and skew your data.

In contrast, inactive customers might begin to buy from you again, and you might overlook them because they've been labeled "inactive."

**Customer Lifetime Value Formula**

The customer lifetime value formula is 

    Customer Lifetime Value = Customer Value x Average Customer Lifespan. 
    
The CLV result is the revenue you expect an average customer to generate during their relationship with your business.

    Typically, lifetime value (LTV) calculates the overall value of all customers. But customer lifetime value (CLV) can also focus on the business value of specific customers or groups of customers.

The formula above is the standard formula to calculate CLV. But finding this important figure can be more complicated than it looks.


Customer Lifetime Value = (Customer Value * Average Customer Lifespan).

To find CLTV, calculate 
          
          customer value = the average purchase value x average number of purchases
          
Once you calculate the average customer lifespan, you can multiply that by customer value to determine customer lifetime value.


You can see both formulas below:
      
    Customer Value = Average Purchase Value x Average Number of Purchases
    Customer Lifetime Value = Customer Value x Average Customer Lifespan

**Average Purchase Value**

Divide your company's total revenue in a period (usually one year) by the number of purchases throughout that same period.

Average purchase value helps you see the average amount of revenue each customer generates during a period. 
Analyzing this number also shows you:

- Opportunities to increase the value of each transaction 
- New options for cross-selling and upselling
- Whether your pricing and packaging strategies are working
- This data helps you find new and viable products or services and other strategies to increase value per transaction and revenue.

**Average Purchase Frequency Rate**

To calculate average purchase frequency rate:

    Divide the number of purchases by the number of unique customers who made purchases during that period.


Recent research says that a 5% customer retention increase can create a 25%+ increase in profit.

Average Purchase Frequency Rate is essential for calculating CLV because it shows you how often customers make repeat purchases. This metric also offers insights into:

Customer engagement and loyalty Trends in customer behavior over time Churn reduction
Future revenue streams
Average Purchase Frequency Rate Challenges
Like average purchase value, inconsistent or incomplete data can also distort your purchase rate numbers.

Other challenges include:
Purchase cycle timing, which can get skewed by industry trends or product releases Changing customer buying patterns
Seasonality

Tips for Calculating Average Purchase Frequency Rate
Track and analyze customer data to capture changing customer buying patterns
Regularly review and update customer segmentation based on buying patterns
ONer personalized promotions to inspire more consistent spending
Conduct customer surveys or interviews for insights into reasons behind changing purchase patterns

**Customer Value**
To calculate customer value, =gure out the average purchase value for your products. Then, calculate the average number of purchases per customer (also called purchase frequency rate). When you multiply these two =gures, it will give you the customer value.

Customer value is important in calculating CLV because it makes it easier to =nd the customers who have the most impact on your revenue. This leads to better strategies, because you can make more eNective decisions when you know what each customer is bringing to your business.
Customer value is also important because it gives you what you need to segment customers by their purchasing habits. Segment insights help you create more targeted, customized experiences for your top customers.

Tips for Calculating Customer Value
Implement a CRM to con=rm data accuracy
Create a consistent process for assigning monetary value to each customer based on
their transaction history
Combine =nancial systems with customer data to show the monetary value of each
customer, like these [nance integrations
Watch customer feedback and sentiment through reviews and social listening to add it
to customer value calculations

**Average Customer Lifespan**

To calculate average customer lifespan:First, figure out the average number of years a customer stays active with your company. Once you have your customer lifespan, you'll divide that by your total customer base to get the average.

ou'll need excellent data management for this =gure, and make sure you don't have duplicate accounts in your data.
Average customer lifespan is useful when calculating CLV. This is because it supports predictions on how long customer relationships will last with data. This helps you make more informed budgeting and resourcing decisions.
It can also help you:
Launch proactive strategies to build customer relationships and reduce churn
Figure out the ROI for customer acquisition Optimize marketing strategies
Find acquisition channels with higher CLV potential
Average Customer Lifespan Challenges
Calculating average customer lifespan can be tough because:
Accurate customer lifecycle tracking needs a robust data management system DiNerent customer segments and subgroups can skew lifespan predictions
Limited customer data or short relationships lead to projections that don't align with actual customer behavior
Tips for Calculating Average Customer Lifespan
Use reliable customer service software to track the customer lifecycle
Include data from diNerent sources and platforms to create a full view of the customer
journey
Capture and analyze data at each stage of the buyer journey to track engagement and
retention
Analyze the average lifespan of each customer segment individually to limit skewed results
Conduct regular trend analysis to predict shifts or changes that may impact lifespan Gather data on customer satisfaction and loyalty
Constantly con=rm and adjust lifespan average based on actual customer behavior and feedback
Customer Acquisition Cost
Customer acquisition cost is not a factor in most CLV formulas, but it can be useful to include in a customer lifetime value analysis.
Comparing how much it costs to acquire a customer with their lifetime value to the business, you can =gure out how to:
Decide how eNective marketing and sales strategies are
Distribute resources wisely
Find =tting opportunities to improve customer retention and acquisition
