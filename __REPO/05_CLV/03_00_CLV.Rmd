## Customer Lifetime Value

**What Is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)?**

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a crucial business metric that estimates the total revenue a business can reasonably expect from a single customer throughout their entire relationship with the company. This metric is essential for understanding how much money customers will spend on your products or services over time.

For example, consider a customer loyal to an auto brand whose vehicles average $30,000 each. If this customer buys three cars from the brand in their lifetime, their CLV is $90,000. Similarly, a person who visits their local coffee chain five days a week and spends $4 on a coffee will have a CLV of $10,400 over the course of 10 years.

Understanding CLV is vital for businesses because it helps determine the appropriate amount of investment in acquiring and retaining customers. It takes into account a customer's revenue value and compares it to the company's predicted customer lifespan.

Customer support and success teams play a significant role in influencing CLV by enhancing the customer's journey. The longer a customer continues to purchase from your company, the greater their lifetime value becomes.
