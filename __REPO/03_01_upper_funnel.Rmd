3. **Content Amplification**: Distributing branded content (blog posts, videos) through paid channels or influencer partnerships to increase reach.

4. **Programmatic Advertising**: Automated, real-time ad buying to target potential customers based on demographics, interests, or online behaviors (via DSPs like The Trade Desk, DV360).
